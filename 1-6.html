        <p>
        We are now to treat summarily of the Disposition of the Wall. But here I must not omit what I have observed among the Ancients; namely, that they constantly avoided drawing any of the outer Lines of the Platform quite strait, so as to let any great Length go on without being interrupted by the Concavity of some curve Line, or the Intersection of some Angle; and the Reason why those wise Men did this is plain, that the Wall, having, as it were, Props joined to it to rest against, might be so much the stronger. In treating of the Walling, we should begin with the most noble Parts of it.

        This Place theresore naturally leads us to speak of the Columns, and of the Things belonging to them; a Row of Columns being indeed nothing else but a Wall open and discontinued in several Places. And having occasion to define a Column, it would not be at all improper to say, that it is a certain strong continued Part of the Wall, carried up perpendicular from the Foundation to the Top, for supporting the Covering. In the whole Compass of the Art of Building, you will find nothing, that either for Workmanship, Expence or Beauty, deserves to be preferred before the Columns. But these Columns having some Particulars in which they differ from one another; in this Place we shall speak only of their Agreement; because that regards the Genus of them; but as to their Difference, which relates to their Species, we shall handle it in its proper Place.
