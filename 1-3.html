    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
             For being to treat of the Design of the Platform, it will not be inconvenient to explain those Things first whereof that Design consists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every Design therefore is composed of Lines and Angles; the Lines are that extreme Design which includes the whole Space of the Platform.

        </p>
        <p>
            That Part of the Superficies of this Design, which is contained between two Lines touching at some certain Point, is called an Angle.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Intersection therefore or crossing of two Lines over each other form four Angles. If each of these Angles be equal to all and each of the other three, they are called right Angles; if they are less, they are called acute, and the greater obtuse.

        </p>
        <p>
    Of Lines too some are strait and others curve; of involved winding Lines it is not necessary to speak here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The strait Line is a Line drawn from one Point to another, the shortest Way that possibly can be.

        </p>
        <p>
            The curve Line is Part of a Circle; a Circle is a Draught made from one of two Points, and turned upon the same Superficies in such a Manner, that in its whole Circumference it is never nearer nor farther from that immoveable Point the Centre, than it was at the first Turn.

        </p>
        <p>
            But to this it is necessary to add, that the curve Line, which was said to be Part of the Circle, among us Architects, for its Similitude, is called an Arch. And the strait Line, which is drawn from the two extreme Points of the curve Line, for the same Reason is called a Chord.

        </p>
        <p>
            And that Line, which goes from the middle Point of the Chord up to the Arch, leaving equal Angles on each Side, is called the Sagitta.

        </p>
        <p>
            And that which is carried from the fixed immoveable Point within the Circle to the curve Line of the Circle, is called the Radius.

        </p>
        <p>
            And that immoveable Point in the Middle is called the Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the Line which passes through the Centre and touches both Sides of the Circumference, is called the Diameter.

        </p>
        <p>
            Arches too are different, for some are entire, some are imperfect, and some are composite.

        </p>
        <p>
            The entire is that which is the full Half of a Circle, or that whose Chord is the Diameter of the whole Circle. The Imperfect is that whose Chord is less than a Diameter, so that this imperfect Arch is Part of a Semiâˆ’circle.

        </p>
        <p>
            The composite Arch is formed of two imperfect Arches, and so the joyning of those two Arches, intersecting each other, makes an Angle at Top, which never happens either in the entire or imperfect Arch.

        </p>
        <p>
            These Things being premised, we proceed as follows.
