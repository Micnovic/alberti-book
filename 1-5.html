    <h3>The Compartition</h3>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
            The whole Force of the Invention and all our Skill and Knowledge in the Art of Building, is required in the Compartition: Because the distinct Parts of the entire Building, and, to use such a Word, the Entireness of each of those Parts, and the Union and Agreement of all the Lines and Angles in the Work, duly ordered for Convenience, Pleasure and Beauty, are disposed and measured out by the Compartition alone: for if a City, according to the Opinion of Philosophers, be no more than a great House, and, on the other Hand, a House be a little City; why may it not be said, that the Members of that House are so many little Houses; such as the Courtyard, the Hall, the Parlour, the Portico, and the like? And what is there in any of these, which, if omitted by Carelessness or Negligence, will not greatly take from the Praise and Dignity of the Work.

        </p>
        <p>
            Great Care and Diligence therefore is to be used in well considering these Things, which so much concern the whole Building; and in so ordering it, that even the most inconsiderable Parts may not be uncomformable to the Rules of Art, and good Contrivance. What has been already said above of the Region and Platform, may be of no small use in doing of this aptly and conveniently; and as the Members of the Body are correspondent to each other, so it is fit that one Part should answer to another in a Building; whence we say, that great Edifices require great Members. Which indeed was so well observed by the Ancients, that they used much larger Bricks, as well as other Materials, about publick and large Buildings, than in private ones.

        </p>
        <p>
            To every Member therefore ought to be allotted its fit Place and proper Situation; not less than Dignity requires, not greater than Conveniency demands; not in an impertinent or indecent Place, but in a Situation so proper to itself, that it could be set no where else more fitly. Nor should the Part of the Structure, that is to be of the greatest Honour, be thrown into a remote Corner; nor that which ought to be the most publick, into a private Hole; nor that which should be most private, be set in too conspicuous a Place.

        </p>
        <p>
            We should besides have regard to the Seasons of the Year, and make a great deal of Difference between hot Places and cold, both in Proportions and Situation. If Rooms for Summer are large and spacious, and those for Winter more compact, it will not be at all amiss; the Summer ones shady and open to the Air, and the Winter ones to the Sun. And here we should provide, that the Inhabitants may not be obliged to pass out of a cold Place into a hot one, without a Medium of temperate Air; or out of a warm one into one exposed to Cold and Winds; because nothing is so prejudicial to human Bodies.

        </p>
        <p>
            And these ought to agree one Member with another to perfect and compose the main Design and Beauty of the whole; that we may not so lay out our whole Study in adorning one Part, as to leave the rest neglected and homely in Comparison of it; but let them bear that Proportion among themselves, that they may appear to be an entire and perfect Body, and not disjointed and unfinished Members. Moreover in the forming of these Members too, we ought to imitate the Modesty of Nature; because in this, as well as in other Cases, the World never commends a Moderation, so much as it blames an extravagant Intemperance in Building. Let the Members therefore be modestly proportioned, and necessary for your Uses. For all Building in general, if you consider it well, owes it's Birth to Necessity, was nursed by Convenience, and embellished by Use; Pleasure was the last Thing consulted in it, which is never truly obtained by Things that are immoderate.

        </p>
        <p>
            Let your Building therefore be such, that it may not want any Members which it has not, and that those which it has, may not in any Respect deserve to be condemned. Nor would I have the Edifice terminated all the Way with even continued Lines void of all manner of Variety; for some please us by their Largeness, others with being little, and others moderate. One Part therefore should be terminated with strait Lines, another with curve, and another again with strait and curve mixed together; provided you observe the Caution I have so often given you, to avoid falling into the Error of Excess, so as to seem to have made a Monster with Limbs disproportionable: Variety is without Dispute a very great Beauty in every Thing, when it joins and brings together, in a regular manner, Things different, but proportionable to each other; but it is rather shocking, if they are unsuitable and incoherent. For as in Musick, when the Base answers the Treble, and the Tenor agrees with both, there arises from that Variety of Sounds an harmonious and wonderful Union of Proportions which delights and enchants our Senses; so the like happens in every thing else that strikes and pleases our Fancy.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, these Things must be so executed, as Use or Conveniency requires, or according to the approved Practice of Men of Skill; because deviating from established Custom, generally robs a Thing of its whole Beauty, as conforming to it, is applauded and attended with Success. Nevertheless, tho' other famous Architects seem, by their Practice, to have determined this or that Compartition, whether Doric, or Ionic, or Corinthian, or Tuscan, to be the most convenient of any; yet they do not thereby tie us down to follow them so closely, as to transcribe their very Designs into this Work of ours; but only stir us up by their Instructions to produce something of our own Invention, and to endeavour to acquire equal or greater Praise than they did. But of these Things we shall speak more distinctly in their proper Places, when we come to consider in what manner a City and its Members ought to be disposed, and every thing necessary for the Convenience of each.
