        <h3><i>ARCHITECT</i> > TO WHAT SORT OF PERSONS THE ARCHITECT OUGHT TO OFFER HIS SERVICE</h3>
    </a>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
            There is one Thing that I must not omit here, which relates personally to the Architect. It is, that you should not immediately run and offer your Service to every Man that gives out he is going to build; a Fault which the inconsiderate and vain-glorious are too apt to be guilty of. I know not whether you ought not to wait till you are more than once importuned to be concerned. Certainly they ought to repose a free and voluntary Confidence in you, that want to make use of your Labours and Advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surely such a Service deserves a suitable Recompence. For this Reason a prudent Man should take care to maintain his Reputation; and certainly it is enough if you give honest Advice, and correct Draughts to such as apply themselves to you. If afterwards you undertake to supervise and compleat the Work, you will find it very difficult to avoid being made answerable for all the Faults and Mistakes committed either by the Ignorance or Negligence of other Men: Upon which Account you must take care to have the Assistance of honest, diligent, and severe Overseers to look after the Workmen under you. I would also have you, if possible, concern yourself for none but Persons of the highest Rank and Quality, and those too such as are truly Lovers of these Arts: Because your Work loses of its Dignity by being done for mean Persons.

        </p>
        <p>
            Do you not see what Weight the Authority of great Men is to advance the Reputation of those who are employed by them? And, indeed, I insist the more upon this Piece of Advice, not only because the World has generally a higher Opinion of the Taste and Judgment of great Men, than for the most Part they deserve, but also because I would have the Architect always readily and plentifully supplied with everything that is necessary for compleating his Edifice; which those of lower Degree are commonly not so able, and therefore not so willing to do: to which add, what we find very frequent Instances of, that where the Design and Invention has been perfectly equal in two different Works, one has been much more esteemed than the other, for the Sake of the Superiority of the Materials.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I advise you not to be so far carried away by the Desire of Glory, as rashly to attempt any thing entirely new and unusual: Therefore be sure to examine and consider thoroughly what you are going to undertake, even in its minutest Parts; and remember how difficult it is to find Workmen that shall exactly execute any extraordinary Idea which you may form, and with how much Grudging and Unwillingness People will spend their Money in making Trial of your Fancies.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, beware of that very common Fault, by means of which there are so few great Structures but what have some unpardonable Blemishes. We always find People very ready to criticize, and fond of being thought Counsellors and Directors. Now as, by reason of the Shortness of Man's Life, few great Works are compleated by the first Undertaker, we that succeed him, either out of Envy or Officiousness, are vain of making some Alteration in his original Design. By this means what was well begun is spoiled in the finishing. For this Reason I think we should adhere to the original Design of the Inventor, who we are to suppose had maturely weighed and considered it. It is possible he might have some wise Inducement to do what he did, which upon a more diligent and attentive Examination, you may at length discover yourself. If however you do make any Alteration, never do it without the Advice, or rather absolute Direction of the most approved and experienced Masters: By which means you will both provide for the Necessities of the Structure, and secure yourself against the Malice of envious Tongues.
