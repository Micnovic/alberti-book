        <h3><i>DESIGNS</i> > THE APERTURES</h3>
    </a>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
            We are now come to treat of the Apertures, which are of two Sorts, the one serving for the Admission of Light and Air, and the other for the Entrance and Passage of the Inhabitants, and of all Manner of Conveniencies all thro' the House.

        </p>
        <p>
            Those for Light are the Windows; those for Passage, the Doors, Stairs, and the Spaces between the Columns: Those too which are for the carrying away of Water and Smoak, as Wells, Sinks, the Gullets, as we may call them of Chimneys, the Mouths of Ovens and Furnaces are also called Apertures. No Room ought to be without a Window, by which the inclosed. Air may be let out and renew' d, because else it will corrupt and grow unwholesome. But such Windows as are exposed to Winds not altogether so healthy, ought to be so proportion'd as to admit what Light is requisite, but not any Thing larger than is just necessary for that Use; and they should likewife be set high, that the Wall may break the Winds before they reach us: Because by this means we shall have Wind enough to renew our Air, but so interrupted as to take off from the ill Effects of it. We should also observe what Suns our House stands to, and according to various Conveniencies make the Windows larger or smaller. In Summer Apartments, if the Windows are to the North, they should be made large every Way; but if they are to the South Sun, it will be proper to make them low and small; such being best adapted for Reception of the Air, and least liable to be offended by the Sun's Rays; and there is no Danger such a Place should ever want Light, when the Sun lies in a Manner continually upon it; so that Shade and not Light is what is to be consulted there. On the contrary in Apartments for Winter, the Windows will be best contrived for admitting the Sun if they are made large, and yet we may avoid being troubled by the Winds at the same Time, if we place them high, so that the cold Air may not blow directly upon the People within. Lastly from whatever Side we take in the Light, we ought to make such an Opening for it, as may always give us a free Sight of the Sky, and the Top of that Opening ought never to be too low, because we are to see the Light with our Eyes; and not with our Heels; besides the Inconvenience, that if one Man gets between nother and the Window, the Light is intercepted, and all the rest of the Room is darken' d, which never happens when the Light comes from above. The Doors should imitate the Windows, that is, be larger or smaller, more or fewer, according to the Frequency or Necessity of the Place.

        </p>
        <p>
            We ought so to order the Proportions of these Openings, as not to make very little ones in great Walls, nor too large in small ones. In these Sorts of Apertures various Designs have been commended; but the best Architects have never made Use of any but Squares and strait Lines. However all have agreed in this, that let them be of what Shape they will, they should be acmodated to the Bigness and Form of the Building. The Doors, then they fay should always be more high than broad; and the highest be such as are capable of receiving two Circles one upon t' other, and the lowest should be of the Heighth of the Diagonal of a Square  whereof the Groundsell is one of the Sides. It is also convenient to place the Doors in such a Manner, that they may lead to as many Parts of the Edifice as possible: And in order to give Beauty to such Apertures, Care must be taken that those of like Dimensions correspond with each other both on the Right and Left. It was usual to leave the Windows and Doors in odd Numbers, but so as for the Side ones to answer each other, and that in the Middle to be somewhat larger than the rest. And particular Regard was always had to the Strength of the Building, for which Reason they contrived to set the Openings clear from the Corners and from the Columns, in the weakest Parts of the Wall, but not so weak as to be insufficient to support the Weight: It being their Custom to raise as many Parts of the Wall as they could plum, and as it were of one Piece without any Interruption from the Foundation quite up to the Covering.

        </p>
        <p>
            There is a certain Kind of an Aperture, which in Form and Position imitates the Doors and Windows, but which does not penetrate the whole Thickness of the Wall, and so, as Niches leave very handsome and convenient Seats for Statues and Paintings. But in what Parts these are to be left, as also how frequent and large, will be shewn more distinctly when we come to treat of the Ornaments of Edifices. We shall only observe here, that they not only add to the Beauty of the Work, but also save some Expence, as they make less Stone and Lime to serve for the Walling. This chiefly is to be taken Care of, that you make these Niches in convenient Numbers, not too big, and of a just Form; and so as in their Order to imitate the Windows. And let them be as you will, I have remark'd in the Structures of the Ancients, that they never used to suffer them to take up above the seventh Part of the Front, nor less than the ninth. The Spaces between the Columns are to be reckoned among the principal Apertures, and are to be lest variously according to the Variety of Buildings. But we shall speak of these more clearly in their proper Place, and chiesly when we treat of Sacred Edifies. Let it be sufficient to premise here, that those Openings should be left in such a Manner, as to have particular Respect to the Nature of the Columns, which are design'd for the Support of the Covering; and first, that those Columns be not too small, nor stand too thin, so as not to be duly able to bear the Weight, nor too big, or set so thick as not to leave open convenient Spaces for Passage.

        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, the Apertures must be different, when the Columns are frequent from what they are when they stand thin, because over frequent Columns we lay an Architrave, and over the others we turn an Arch. But in all Openings over which we make Arches, we should contrive to have the Arch never less than a half Circle, with an Addition of the seventh Part of half its Diameter: The most experienced Workmen having found that Arch to be by much the best adapted for enduring in a Manner to Perpetuity; all other Arches being thought less strong for supporting the Weight, and more liable to ruin. It is moreover imagined, that the half Circle is the only Arch which has no Occasion either for Chain or any other Fortification; and all others, if you don't either chain them or place some Weight against them for a Counterpoise, are found by their own Weight to burst out and fall to ruin.

        </p>
        <p>
            I will not omit here what I have taken Notice of among the Ancients, a Contrivance certainly very excellent and Praiseworthy: Their best Architects placed these Apertures and the Arches of the Roofs of their Temples in such a Manner, that even tho' you took away every Column from under them, yet they would still stand firm and not fall down, the Arches on which the Roof was placed being drawn quite down to the Foundation with wonderful Art, known but to few: So that the Work upheld itself by being only set upon Arches; for those Arches having the solid Earth for their Chain, no Wonder they stood firm without any other Support.
