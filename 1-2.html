        <h3><i>DESIGNS</i> > OF THE FIRST OCCASION OF ERECTING EDIFICIES</h3>
    </a>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
        The whole Art of Building consists in six Things, which are these: The Region, the Seat or Platform, the Compartition, the Walling, the Covering and the Apertures;
    </p>
    <p>
        And if these Principles are first thoroughly conceived, that which is to follow will the more easily be understood. We shall therefore define them thus, the Region with us shall be the whole large open Place in which we are to build, and of which the Seat or Platform shall be only a Part: But the Platform shall be a determined Spot of the Region, circumscribed by Walls for Use and Service. But under the Title of Platform, we shall likewise include all those Spaces of the Buildings, which in walking we tread upon with our Feet.

    </p>
    <p>
        The compartition is that which subdivides the whole platform of the House into smaller platforms, so that the whole Edifice thus formed and constituted of these its Members, seems to be full of lesser Edifices: By Walling we shall understand all that Structure, which is carried up from the Ground to the Top to support the Weight of the Roof, and such also as is raised on the Inside of the Building, to separate the Apartments;

    </p>
    <p>
        Covering we shall call not only that Part, which is laid over the Top of the Edifice to receive the Rain, but any Part too which is extended in length and breadth over the Heads of those within; which includes all Ceilings, halsarched Roofs, Vaults, and the like. Apertures are all those Outlets, which are in any Part of the Building, for the Convenience of Egress and Regress, or the Passage of Things necessary for the Inmates.

    </p>
    <p>
        Of these therefore we shall treat, and of all the Parts of each, having first premised some Things, which whether they are Principles, or necessary Concomitants of the Principles of this Work which we have undertaken, are certainly very much to our Purpose. We found three Things by no means to be neglected, which relate particularly to the Covering, the Walling, and the like: Namely, that each of them be adapted to some certain and determinate Conveniency, and above all, be wholesome. That they be firm, solid, durable, in a Manner eternal, as to Stability: And as to Gracefulness and Beauty, delicately and justly adorned, and set off in all their Parts.

    </p>
    <p>
        Having laid down these Principles as the Foundations of what we are to write, we proceed to our Subject.
