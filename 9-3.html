        <p>
            Then observing, that those three Things which we have already mentioned, namely, the Number, Finishing and Collocation, were what chiefly conduced to make the whole beautiful, they found how they were to make use of this from a thorough Examination of the Works of Nature, and, as I imagine, upon the following Principles. The first Thing they observed, as to Number, was that is was of two Sorts, even and uneven, and they made use of both, but in different Occasions: For, from the Imitation of Nature, they never made the Ribs of their Structure, that is to say, the Columns, Angles and the like, in uneven Numbers; as you shall not find any Animal that stands or moves upon an odd Number of Feet.

        </p>
        <p>
            On the contrary, they made their Apertures always in uneven Numbers, as Nature herself has done in some Instances, for tho' in Animals she has placed an Ear, an Eye, and a Nostril on each Side, yet the great Aperture, the Mouth, she has set singly in the Middle.
