        <p>
            The Windows in the Temple ought to be small and high, so that nothing but the Sky may be seen through them; to the Intent that both the Priests that are employed in the Performance of divine Offices, and those that assist upon Account of Devotion, may not have their Minds any Ways diverted by foreign Objects. That Horror with which a solemn Gloom is apt to sill the Mind naturally raises our Veneration, and there is always somewhat of an Austerity in Majesty: Besides that those Lights which should be always burning in Temples, and than which nothing is more awful for the Honour and Ornament of Religion, look faint and languish, unless favoured by some Obscurity. For this Reason the Ancients were very often contented without any other Aperture besides the Gate. For my own Part, I am for having the Entrance into the Temple thoroughly well lighted, and those Parts within, where People are to walk, not melancholy; but the Place where the Altar is to be seated, I think should have more of Majesty than Beauty. But to return to the Apertures themselves. Let us here remember what has formerly been said, namely, that Apertures consist of three Parts, the Void, the Jambs and the Lintel, which two last we may call the Frame of the Door or Window. The Ancients never used to make either Doors or Windows otherwise than square.
