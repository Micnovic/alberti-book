        <h3><i>DESIGNS</i> > THE STAIRCASES</h3>
    </a>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
        The placing of the Stairs is a Work of such Nicety, that without deliberate and mature Consideration you can never place them well: For in a Staircase there meet three Apertures: One, the Door by which you enter upon the Stairs; another, the Window that supplies you with Light to see the Steps by, and the third, the Opening in the Ceiling which lets you into the Area above; and therefore it is said to be no Wonder, that the Stairs should perplex the Design of a Structure; but let him that is desirous to have the Stair not hinder him, take Car√© not to hinder the Stair, but allow it a determinate and just Portion of the Platform, in order to give its free Course quite up to the Covering at the Top of all. And do not let us repine that the Staircase should take up so much of the Area, for it furnishes us with very many Conveniencies, and is no Inconvenience to the other Parts of the Building. Add to this, that those little Vaults and Spaces under the Stairs are very serviceable for a great many Purposes. Our Staircases therefore are of two Sorts (for as to those Steps or Ladders which belong to military Expeditions, I shall not speak of them here.) The first is that which has no Steps, but is mounted by a sloping Ascent, and the other is that which is mounted by Steps.

        And I have observed, that the best architects never put above seven, or at most nine steps together in one flight; imitating I suppose, the number either of the planets or of the heavens; but at the end of these seven or nine steps, they very considerately made a plain, that such as were weak or tired with the fatigue of the sacent, might have leisure to rest themselves, and that if they should chance to stumble, there might be a place to break their fall, and give them means to recover themselves. And I am thoroughly of opinion, that the stairs ought to be frequently interrupted by these landing places, and that they should be well lighted, and be ample and spacious according to the dignity of the place.
