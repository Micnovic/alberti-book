    <h3>Congruity</h3>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
        From hence we may conclude, to avoid Prolixity in this Research, that there are three Things principally in which the Whole of what we are looking into consists: The Number, and that which I have called the Finishing, and the Collocation. But there is still something else besides, which arises from the Conjunction and Connection of these other Parts, and gives the Beauty and Grace to the Whole: Which we will call Congruity, which we may consider as the Original of all that is graceful and handsome. The Business and Office of Congruity is to put together Members differing from each other in their Natures, in such a Manner, that they may conspire to form a beautiful Whole: So that whenever such a Composition offers itself to the Mind, either by the Conveyance of the Sight, Hearing, or any of the other Senses, we immediately perceive this Congruity: For by Nature we desire Things perfect, and adhere to them with Pleasure when they are offered to us; nor does this Congruity arise so much from the Body in which it is found, or any of its Members, as from itself, and from Nature, so that its true Seat is in the Mind and in Reason; and accordingly it has a very large Field to exercise itself and flourish in, and runs through every Part and Action of Man's Life, and every Production of Nature herself, which are all directed by the Law of Congruity, nor does Nature study anything more than to make all her Works absolute and perfect, which they could never be without this Congruity, since they would want that Consent of Parts which is so necessary to Perfection. But we need not say more upon this Point, and if what we have here laid down appears to be true, we may conclude Beauty to be such a Consent and Agreement of the Parts of a Whole in which it is found, as to Number, Finishing and Collocation, as Congruity, that is to say, the principal Law of Nature requires. This is what Architecture chiefly aims at, and by this she obtains her Beauty, Dignity and Value.
