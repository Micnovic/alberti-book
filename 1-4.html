        <h3><i>DESIGNS</i> > THE KINDS OF PLATFORMS</h3>
    </a>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
        Of Platforms, some are angular and others circular; of the angular, some consist all of right Lines, and some of right Lines and curve mixed together. And where they are, make the Edifice handsome and convenient. It is that the Angles, the Lines and all the Parts have a certain Variety, but so ordered both for Use and Beauty, that the entire Parts may answer to the entire, and like Parts to like.

    </p>
    <p>
        Right Angles are very convenient; the Acute are never used even in mean inconsiderable Platforms, unless upon absolute Necessity, or the Constraint of the Nature and Manner of the Situation, or to make some other Part of the Platform more graceful. The obtuse Angles, have been thought very convenient, but it has always been observed as a Rule never to place them anywhere in unequal Numbers.

    </p>
    <p>
        The circular Platform is esteemed to be the most capacious of all, and the least expensive to enclose either with Wall or Rampart. The nearest to this is said to be that which has several Sides, but then they must be all alike and answerable to each other, and equal throughout the whole Platform. But those are commended most of all, which are most convenient for raising the Wall to the just Heighth of the Work, as are those which have six and eight Sides. I have seen a Platform of ten Angles very commodious and majestick. You may make them very well of twelve, nay, sixteen Angles. I myself have seen one of twenty four; but these are very rare.

    </p>
    <p>
        The Side Lines ought to be so ordered, that those which are opposite may be equal to them, nor should we ever in any Work apply a long Line to correspond to a short one; but let there be a just and reasonable Proportion, according to the Degree of the Thing, among all the Parts. We would have the Angles set towards that Side, which either any Weight of Earth, or the Violence and Assaults of Waters or Winds may threaten and endanger; to the Intent that the Force and Shock that beats upon the Edifice may be broken and split into several Parts, resisting the Attack (to use such an Expression) with the stout Corner of the Wall, and not with one of the weak Sides. But if the other Lineaments of the Structure hinder you from disposing of such an Angle in such a Part as you could desire, at least make use of a curve Line; that being a Part of a Circle, and the Circle itself according to the Philosophers being all Angles.

    </p>
    <p>
        Further, the Seat must be either upon a Plain, or on the Side or Top of a Hill; if it is on a Plain, it is necessary to raise the Earth and make something of an Eminence; for besides that, such a Situation in a Plain adds much of Dignity. For the overflowing of Rivers and Rains generally leaves Mud upon level Grounds, which by degrees raises the Earth higher and higher, which still increases, if through Negligence the Rubbish and Dirt, which gathers every Day be not removed.
