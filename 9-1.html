            The most expert Artists among the Ancients, as we have observed elsewhere, were of Opinion, that an Edifice was like an Animal, so that in the Formation of it we ought to imitate Nature. Let us therefore enquire how it happens that in the Bodies produced by Nature herself some are accounted more, others less beautiful, or even deformed.

        </p>
        <p>
            It is manifest, that in those which are esteemed beautiful, the Parts or Members are not constantly all the same, so as not to differ in any Respect: But we find, that even in those Parts wherein they vary most, there is something inherent and implanted which though they differ extremely from each other, makes each of them beautiful. I will make use of an Example to illustrate my Meaning. Some admire a Woman for being extremely slender and fine shaped; the young Gentleman in Terence prefered a Girl that was plump and fleshy: You perhaps are for a Medium between these two Extremes, and would neither have her so thin as to seem wasted with Sickness, nor so strong and robust as if she were a Ploughman in Disguise, and were fit for Boxing: In short, you would have her such a Beauty as might be formed by taking from the first what the second might spare.

        </p>
        <p>
            But then because, one of these pleases you more than the other, would you therefore affirm the other to be not at all handsome or graceful? By no means; but there may be some hidden Cause why one should please you more than the other, into which I will not now pretend to enquire. But the Judgment which you make that a Thing is beautiful, does not proceed from mere Opinion, but from a secret Argument and Discourse implanted in the Mind itself; which plainly appears to be so from this, that no Man beholds any Thing ugly or deformed, without an immediate Hatred and Abhorrence. Whence this Sensation of the Mind arises, and how it is formed, would be a Question too subtle for this Place: However, let us consider and examine it from those Things which are obvious, and make more immediately to the Subject in Hand: For without Question there is a certain Excellence and natural Beauty in the Figures and Forms of Buildings, which immediately strike the Mind with Pleasure and Admiration.

        </p>
        <p>
            It is my Opinion, that Beauty, Majesty, Gracefulness, and the like Charms, consist in those Particulars which if you alter or take away, the Whole would be made homely and disagreeable. If we are convinced of this, it can be no very tedious Enquiry to consider those Things which may be taken away, encreased or altered, especially in Figures and Forms: For every Body consists of certain peculiar Parts, of which if you take away any one, or lessen, or enlarge it, or remove it to an improper Place; that which before gave the Beauty and Grace to this Body will at once be lamed and spoild.
